I.  The probability of the coin landing on its tail is (1 - h).

Proof

The events being considered are:

1. The coin lands on its head.
2. The coin lands on its tail.

Since these two events cannot occur at the same time, they are disjoint.
By Axiom 3, we know that

P(head or tail) = P(head) + P(tail)

Further, these two events are the only possible events being considered (i.e. the sample space S), we know that

P(S) = P(head or tail) = P(head) + P(tail)

From Axiom 2, we know that the probability of the sample space (S) is one. It follows that

1 = P(S)
1 = P(head or tail)
1 = P(head) + P(tail)

Given that P(head) = h, we have

P(tail) = 1 - P(head) = 1 - h


II.  The minimum value of P(tail) is 0 and the maximum value of P(tail) is 1.

Proof

By Axiom 1, we know that the following are true.

h >= 0
P(tail) >= 0

Therefore, the minimum value of P(tail) is 0.

And from Part I, we know that

P(tail) = 1 - h

Therefore, the maximum value of P(tail) occurs when h is at its minimum.
In other words, P(tail) is maximum when h is 0.

max P(tail) = max (1 - h) = 1 - min h = 1 - 0 = 1

Therefore, the maximum value of P(tail) is 1.
